# Road Segmentation for Autonomous Driving Using FCN

## Introduction

This project, titled "Road Segmentation for Autonomous Driving Using FCN", focuses on applying a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model to segment roads in videos captured from a self-driving car's perspective. The objective is to accurately identify and highlight road areas, which is a crucial component for the navigation and safety systems in autonomous vehicles.

## Project Overview

The project uses a deep learning approach, specifically a Fully Convolutional Network, to perform semantic segmentation. This involves classifying each pixel in the image to determine whether it is part of the road. The model is trained on a dataset of road images and then used to process video footage, overlaying a mask on the road areas.
